\note{
  In this lecture, I'll present a case study on random transposon
  mutagenesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Traditional frequentist
  methods are not suitable for this problem, and so I resorted to
  using Bayesian statistics, with Markov chain Monte Carlo.

\begin{frame}{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}

  \bbi
\item The organism that causes tuberculosis.
  \bi
\item Cost for treatment: $\sim$\$15,000
\item Other bacterial pneumonias: $\sim$\$35
  \ei

\item 4.4 Mbp circular genome, completely sequenced
\item 4250 known or inferred genes
  \ei

\note{
  Tuberculosis can be surprisingly difficult and expensive to treat.
  So there's good reason to try to better understand its genome, to
  identify potential targets for new drugs.

  \centerline{\Large {\color{title} Method}: random transposon mutagenesis}

\note{
  The current project seeks to identify the {\hilit essential} genes
  in the M.\ tuberculosis genome; the ones that if you knock them out,
  you get a non-viable mutant.

  This is done by random transposon mutageneis. A transposon is a bit
  of DNA that likes to insert itself into other DNA. So we'll randomly
  disrupt genes to find out which ones matter and which ones don't so much.

\centerline{\hilit Note: $\ge$ 30 stop codons in each reading frame}

\note{
   They used the \emph{Himar1\/} transposon which randomly inserts
   itself into a site {\hilit TA}.

   ``Stop codons'' are codes for where a gene stops. The point is that
   if this thing gets inserted into a gene, it will end up with a
   truncated product.
