## Important lessons

- file organization, documentation, version control: investments that
  pay off in the long term

- the most important thing is that you get the right answer

- always ask: does this make sense?

- if it seems too good to be true, it probably is

- artifacts can sometimes be the most interesting finding, so follow
  up on them to figure out what's going on. They're usually just
  error, though. But still important to follow up.

- time to solve a computational problem includes the time to formulate a solution,
  to write the program, to run the program, and to make sense of the
  results. Program run time is almost always the least of these.

- if you find a bug, first create a test that reproduces it, then fix it

- capture the full process of data cleaning (what you did, what you
  saw, how you interpreted it, why you made the decisions you made),
  because you'll want that information later

- use computer simulations to check that your software/method is
  giving reasonable results
