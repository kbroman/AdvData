\note{
  An often neglected aspect in discussions of reproducible research:
  software and data need to be licensed. If you want your software and
  data to be reused, you need to provide an explicit license that
  explains exactly how the software and data may be reused.

  I'm going to try to explain the issues and give suggestions about
  licenses to consider. But I'm no expert, and I'm definitely {\nhilit
  not a lawyer}. I don't guarantee that this is entirely correct.

  If you will be sharing data on human subjects, or, for that matter,
  just working with data on human subjects, you need to be extra
  careful. I'll try to sketch the basic concerns.

  I'm talking just about the United States here. I understand US law a
  bit, but I don't know the law in other countries much at all.

\note{This is an edited version of an email I got from a collaborator,

  I try to always include some brief data summaries at the start of
  such reports. By doing so, he immediately saw that I had an old
  version of the data.

  Because I'd set things up carefully, I could just substitute in the
  newer dataset, type ``{\tt make}'', and get the revised report.

  This is a reproducibility success story. But it took me a long
  time to get to this point.

\begin{frame}{Intellectual property}

\addtocounter{framenumber}{-1}

\bbi
\item Manuscripts/journal articles
\item Books
\item Software
\item Data sets
\item Ideas, inventions
\item Lab/research notebooks
\item Instructional materials
\item Web sites
\ei

\note{
 Intellectual property is property (ie, someone can own it) that is not
 an actual thing but more the idea of the thing. For example, it's not
 the actual physical book, but the text in the book. It's
 not an actual physical art work, but any depiction of the content of
 that artwork. This can get pretty complicated; it's best to move on.

 Most of what academics produce is intellectual property.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{IP protection}

\bbi
\item Copyright
\item Patents
\item Trademarks, Trade "dress"
\item Trade secrets
\ei

\note{
  Different kinds of intellectual property are protected in different
  ways. I'm going to focus on copyright.

  An important point to mention here is that an {\nhilit idea},
  {\nhilit fact} or {\nhilit algorithm} can't be copyrighted. Ideas
  and algorithms can be protected with a patent, but {\nhilit facts}
  (including individual data points) can be neither copyrighted nor
  patented.

  So, for example, copyright protection says that you may not be able
  to copy and use someone's exact code, but you can grab all of the
  ideas and re-implement them in your own way. Unless the ideas or
  algorithms are patented, and then you have to get their permission
  to use them, even if it's your own implementation.
}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Copyright}

\bbi
\item Copyright is automatic
\item In "works for hire," the employer holds the copyright
\item In academics, it is customary that researchers control copyright
\onslide<2->{\item At
  \href{https://grad.wisc.edu/acadpolicy/\#responsibleconductofresearch}{UW-Madison}:
    \vspace{6pt}

    \begin{quote} \footnotesize \lolit
      "Except as required by funding agreements or other university
      policies, the university does not claim ownership rights in the
      intellectual property generated during research by its faculty,
      staff, or students."
    \end{quote}
}

\ei

\note{
  \vspace{-8pt}
  Since 1978, works you create are automatically copyrighted. That
  includes data, software, papers, books, talks, posters, course syllabi,
  and lecture notes. Since 1989, you don't need to include a copyright notice.

  In many job situations, your employer will own the copyright on
  works that you create as part of your employment.  But in academic
  settings, it is traditional that researchers retain copyright on the
  works they create. But there are exceptions, and universities are
  increasingly interested in generating income from the intellectual
  property of their faculty.

  Also, students may be treated somewhat differently from other
  employees. Academic staff may be treated differently from faculty,
  for that matter. Ideally, the exact rules are written down
  somewhere. Find the rules and read them, and ask questions about
  them.

  At UW-Madison, faculty, staff, and students own the intellectual
  property of the works they produce except in some special cases,
  such as instructional materials produced with significant university
  resources. And if you're going to patent something, it must be
  through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF).

\note{
  Copyright protection gives the author exclusive rights to the work
  and to derivatives of the work.

  Thus, the default is that no one can copy, modify, or redistribute
  your code.

\begin{frame}{Software licenses}

\bbi
\item Critical if you {\hilit want} your code to be reused.
\item Also important to protect yourself from lawsuits.
\item I choose between the MIT license and the GPL.
\item {\hilit Don't} use Creative Commons licenses for software!
\ei

\note{
  If you don't indicate a license for your software, others {\hilit
  can't} reuse it. You need to be explicit about whether and how your
  software may be reused, by providing a license.

  I choose between the MIT license and the GNU General Public License
  (GPL). The MIT license is as open as possible: do whatever you want,
  just don't sue me. The GPL is ``viral'' (they say ``copyleft'') in that extends to
  derivative works: software that incorporates code under the GPL must
  also be under the GPL.

  The Creative Commons licenses may work for data, but they're more
  for text, music, video, and such things. They {\nhilit should not}
  be used for code, as they are not compatible with other standard
  software licenses, such as the GPL. That means that you wouldn't be
  able to mix in code that was licensed under the GPL.

\note{
  I can't emphasize this enough. If you release your software without
  a license, no one can modify it or incorporate it into their own
  software, as it's under copyright protection.

  If you want your software to be reused, pick a license, and make the
  licensing absolutely clear.

\item CC BY-NC-SA {\lolit (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)}
\item CC BY-NC-ND {\lolit (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs)}
\ei

\note{
  The Creative Commons licenses are really useful for things like
  manuscripts, data files, videos, web sites, and such.

  You shouldn't use them for software, as they can't be mixed with the
  GPL, and they make no explicit mention of source or object code.
  In the FAQ at Creative Commons, they explicitly recommend {\nhilit
  against} the use of CC licenses for software.

  BY means people must cite you as the originator.

  SA means that derivative works must be distributed under the same
  license.

  ND means the work must be distributed in its entirety, without any
  changes.

  NC means the work can't be used in a commercial setting.
}

\begin{frame}{CC licenses: issues to consider}

  \bi
  \item but maybe you don't care
  \ei
\item ND is {\vhilit really} restrictive
 \bi
 \item all or none

\ei

\note{
  There are a lot of issues to consider.

  I'd recommend avoiding ND and probably also NC.

  Personally, I'm going with CC0 (by academic tradition, people should
  still cite you) or CC-BY. It means that a company could grab my
  stuff and make money off of it. But I'm fine with that. I'd rather
  see the results of my efforts put to further use.

\item Can assign a license to the data files to prevent extraction and
  redistribution
\item See \href{http://bitlaw.com/copyright/database.html}{\tt bitlaw.com/copyright/database.html}
\ei

\note{
  Data are viewed as facts and so they {\nhilit can't} be copyrighted.

  Your data file or database, though, {\nhilit can} be copyrighted,
  if its compilation involves some creativity, and that would
  generally be true for scientific data files.

  So people can't redistribute your data files unless you say it's
  okay. But they may be able to extract and reformat the data and then
  distribute that.

  If you want to prevent extraction and redistribution, the data files
  need a license, which would say the end user is prohibited from
  extracting data for uses other than intended.
}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Keep data open}

\bbi
\item Cite the source; cite the relevant papers
\item Talk to the originator of the data

  \item Even if redistribution is legal, don't piss them off.

\item For your own data, use
  \href{https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/}{CC0}
  (public domain)
\item If you want more control, talk to a lawyer
\ei

\note{
  Statisticians, in particular, should want data to be openly
  available. And so you should cite the source of data and any
  relevant papers, not just because that's the academic tradition, but
  also because we want to reward, as much as possible, people who
  make data accessible.

  Even if it's perfectly legal for you to re-distribute data, you
  should talk to the originator of the data before doing so. You don't
  want them to get annoyed and then stop distributing data in the
  future.

  If you want data to be reused, just put it in the public domain.
  Don't add any extra complexities, like CC-BY.

  If you want to control reuse or redistribution, talk to a lawyer. It
  seems really complicated.

\note{
  Any research on human subjects must be reviewed by an IRB.

  If you're considering publishing a paper about it, and if humans are
  involved, it's human subjects research. That includes things like
  surveys. So informed consent, and review by IRB, with a clearly
  defined protocol and protection of data.

  You can do a survey {\nhilit within a class} and it may not be
  research, but then you can't publish the results.

  The NIH considers the analysis of anonymized human data to be ``not
  human subjects research,'' and it may be exempt from full IRB
  review, but IRBs generally want to make such determinations
  themselves: you need to fill out some amount of paperwork.

\ei

\note{
  HIPAA is really important, but it's also a real pain.

  The key thing is that medical data with {\nhilit any} identifying
  information needs a whole bunch of paperwork if
  transferred/disclosed, and there need to be special security
  measures.

  And the definition of ``identifying information'' is surprisingly
  broad.
