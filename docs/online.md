**[COVID-19](https://covid19.wisc.edu)**: Starting 24 March, and through the rest of the semester,
lectures and office hours will be strictly online.

### Lectures

For lectures, we will use [BBCollaborate
Ultra](https://it.wisc.edu/services/web-conferencing/) accessible via
the [course Canvas site](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/192687).
You should just need a web browser. They recommend Chrome, though
Firefox seems to work just fine for me. (Also, Safari on my iPad seems
to work well.)

We will meet at the usual time (Tues/Thurs 11-12:15 CDT). I will
record the session and make that available for viewing or download at
the [course Canvas site](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/192687), in
case you can't participate live.
I will also continue to make my slides and notes available at the [course
site](https://kbroman.org/AdvData). Participating in the live lecture
will allow you to ask questions in real time, but I welcome questions
at any time, by email or during office hours, or if let me know I can
open up discussion threads on Canvas.

To get to the online lecture, go to the
[course Canvas site](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/192687) and click
"BBCollaborate Ultra" on the left. You can also use the [guest
url](https://bit.ly/lec826_sp2020), <https://bit.ly/lec826_sp2020>.

There's also an option to join by phone, at least for the audio. You
could download the slides separately and follow along. But I think
each student needs to get a unique PIN, so go to the [BBCollaborate
session](https://bit.ly/lec826_sp2020) to get the call-in number and
your PIN.

I expect that I'll start with everyone muted and have you ask
questions either in chat or by electronically raising your hand (and
at that point you could turn on your microphone, and your video camera
if you wish).

There's a [course
room](https://us.bbcollab.com/guest/fa00f2b58c214533800f00a44ac85a75)
for BBCollaborate Ultra if you want to test out your audio in advance.


### Office hours

I also plan to hold office hours using [BBCollaborate
Ultra](https://it.wisc.edu/services/web-conferencing/).
Go to <https://bit.ly/offhrs_sp2020>.

You can also join the office hours by phone, but again I think each
student needs to get a unique PIN, so go to the [BBCollaborate
session](https://bit.ly/offhrs_sp2020) to get the call-in number and
your PIN.

I will be available there Tuesdays 9:30-10:30 and Fridays 10:30-11:30,
starting 24 March.

If you would like to get ahold of me at a different time or using a
different method, let me know by email.
