### Homework assignments

There will be four written homework assignments that will involve some
sort of data analysis.

Format your write-ups like a report for a collaborator. Explain your
goals, what you did (and why), what you observed, and what you
concluded. It should be mostly text and figures with perhaps some
tabular results. Code and equations should be at a minimum, and they
are best placed in an appendix. Each figure should usually be
accompanied by at least a paragraph or two of text. Don't show me
everything you did; focus on the bits that are most important to
support your conclusions.

Do your best to ensure that your analysis is reproducible. I prefer to
receive electronic copies of reports by email; the url for a github
repository would be ideal but use of git is not required.

You are encouraged to talk to each other about the assignments, but
the analysis reports should be written individually.
