title: Advanced data analysis
description: A course in advanced data analysis
---

Good data analysis requires a number of skills (including the munging
of messy data files, data diagnostics, exploratory data visualization,
identifying an appropriate statistical model, deriving a good-enough
estimator, quantifying uncertainty, assessing model fit, and organizing reproducible
analyses) but also a way of thinking about data. The goal for this
course is to help students improve their skills in exploring and
answering questions with data. This will be accomplished with a series
of case studies, a set of skill-oriented tutorials, and substantial
project-based homework assignments.
