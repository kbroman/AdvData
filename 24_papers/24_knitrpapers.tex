\note{
  This lecture is about how to create reproducible manuscripts, for
  journal articles. KnitR with R Markdown is great for informal
  reports. KnitR with AsciiDoc is great for somewhat fancier
  reports. There are a number of efforts, especially with Pandoc, to
  use R Markdown for journal articles. But if you want fine control
  over the appearance of a document, it's hard to beat \LaTeX, and so
  I'm just going to focus on that.

  I can't hope to explain \LaTeX\/ properly in just this one
  lecture. My goals are to give the general gist, indicate resources
  and options, and show how to use KnitR with \LaTeX.

  I also want to discuss some more general strategies for ensuring that
  the results described in a journal article are fully reproducible.

\begin{frame}[c,fragile]{\LaTeX}

\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\usepackage{graphicx}

\title{An example document}
\author{Karl Broman}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
\thispagestyle{empty}

\section{A section}

This is a simple example of a \LaTeX\/ document for an article.
Here's some in-line math: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$.

And here's a display equation:

$$ \hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'y $$

\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

\note{
  \LaTeX\/ is like html or Markdown: plain text with special codes to
  indicate how things are to appear.

  A \LaTeX\/ document always starts with {\tt {\textbackslash}documentclass}, then a
  bunch of overall controlling information. The actual document is
  between {\tt {\textbackslash}begin\{document\}} and {\tt {\textbackslash}end\{document\}}.

  {\tt {\textbackslash}usepackage\{\}} is like {\tt library()} in R.

  Ideally, you focus on {\nhilit semantics} rather than {\nhilit
  style}: define the {\tt {\textbackslash}title\{\}} and {\tt {\textbackslash}author\{\}} and use
  {\tt {\textbackslash}maketitle} to have them included in the document, and
  indicate sections and subsections with {\tt {\textbackslash}section\{\}} and
  {\tt {\textbackslash}subsection\{\}}.

  For some reason, {\tt {\textbackslash}thispagestyle\{empty\}} (``don't
  show page number on this page'') needs
  to be placed {\nhilit after} {\tt {\textbackslash}maketitle}.

  A key feature of \LaTeX\/ is the mathematics typesetting. There's no
  better system. And your \LaTeX\/ skills can be immediately
  transferred to your Markdown documents, with MathJax.

  In reality, for a paper, I don't use {\tt {\textbackslash}maketitle}

  hard-coding the placement of things.

  need to change the style, it's easier if your document is defined in

\begin{frame}{Why \LaTeX\/?}

\bbi
\item Fine control of document appearance
\item Transparency of how that was achieved
\item Version control (diff/merge)
\item Typesetting equations
\item Markdown's not quite ready, or sufficiently rich
  \bi
  \item[] (but see the R package \href{https://github.com/rstudio/rticles}{rticles})
  \ei
\ei


\note{
  It's {\nhilit a lot} of work to learn \LaTeX, so we need to be clear
  about why we'd want to devote the effort to it.

  For reproducible research, we need some sort of code-based document
  system (i.e., {\nvhilit not Word!}), and \LaTeX\/ gives you the most
  fine-grained control, if you need it. Ultimately, I hope, Markdown
  will be sufficient, but for now, we often need \LaTeX\/.

  The code-based control makes what you're trying to do
  transparent.  And you should treat \LaTeX\/ like code: write clearly
  and simply, and comment the tricky bits.

  This sort of document also has the advantage of easy treatment of
  {\tt diff} and {\tt merge} in a version control system like git.

  The real power of \LaTeX\/ is in the typesetting of mathematical
  equations. And what you learn on that aspect can be transferred to
  your Markdown documents, using MathJax. (But I already said that,
  didn't I?)

Focus your compulsive behavior on things that matter.

\note{
  I've said this before, but I like to repeat it.

  Focus on the text and the figures before worrying too much about
  fine details of how they appear on the page.

  And consider which is more important: a manuscript, web page, blog,
  grant, course slides, course handout, report to collaborator,
  scientific poster.

  You can spend a ton of time trying to get things to look just
  right. Ideally, you spend that time trying to construct a general
  solution.  Or you can modify your desires to more closely match what
  you get without any effort.

\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

\note{
  KnitR works well with LaTeX.

  Most of what you learned about KnitR with R Markdown transfers
  directly to working with LaTeX.

  The main difference is the way in which code chunks are
  indicated. You use {\tt <<>>=} and {\tt @} for chunks, and
  {\tt {\textbackslash}Sexpr\{\}} for in-line code.

  KnitR basically does a search-and-replace for code
  chunks. Different patterns will be easier, depending on the nature
  of the surrounding code.

  The chunk options are the same. Here, I used
  {\tt out.width="0.8{\textbackslash}textwidth"}
  to make the figure appear as 80\% of the width of the page.

  {\tt out.width} and {\tt out.height} need units as in \LaTeX\/ (built into
  {\tt {\textbackslash\textbackslash}textwidth}; otherwise {\tt "in"}
  or {\tt "cm"} or {\tt "pt"} or whatever).

  {\tt fig.width} and {\tt fig.height} are as in R, with implied units.

  it. (LyX is not really ``WYSIWYG'' but rather ``WYSIWYM,'' but
  that's what you want most, anyway.)

\note{
  In addition to regular \LaTeX, there's pdflatex (which I mostly
  use). It has the advantage of being able to include pdf, jpg, and
  png figures, and produces a PDF file directly.

  XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX are great for fonts and Unicode.

  I've not mentioned that behind the scenes is \TeX, which is the
  source of all of this. Believe or not, \LaTeX\/ exists because
  \TeX\/ is even harder. PdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and LuoLaTeX, really
  derive from PdfTeX, XeTex, and LuoTex.

\note{
  There is {\nhilit a ton} of online information about \LaTeX. Start

  My last point here is basically that one way to help yourself is by

\end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}


\note{
  If you use the chunk option {\tt fig.cap}, the figure will get a
  caption.

  But it will also be embedded within a {\tt figure} ``environment.''
  (That is, between {\tt {\textbackslash}begin\{figure\}} and
  {\tt {\textbackslash}end\{figure\}}.)

  This makes it a ``float.'' \LaTeX\/ decides where it's going to be
  placed. The placement of floats is {\nvhilit the biggest pain} in
  using \LaTeX.

  The figure also gets a label, from the chunk name. (The
  {\tt {\textbackslash}label\{\}} bit.) This allows you to
  cross-reference the figure, to have the figure number determined
  automatically.

  The cross reference would be with {\tt {\textbackslash}ref\{fig:fig\_with\_caption\}}.

  When you use cross references, you need to run \LaTeX\/ twice: once
  to establish where things will sit on the page and how they are
  numbered, and a second time to insert the cross references.

\end{tabular}
\end{lstlisting}

\note{
  Tables in \LaTeX\/ are a pain, but they offer extremely fine
  control.

  But writing this sort of code ({\tt \&} indicates breaks between
  columns, {\tt {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}} indicates the end of
  a row) {\nhilit reproducibly} is hard.

xtab <- xtable(lm.out, digits=c(0,2,2,1,2))

\note{
  xtable is a superb R package for producing \LaTeX\/ tables.
  You don't have complete control, but you do have a ton of
  control. The xtableGallery vignette shows you much of what can be
  done.

  Note that a lot of the options are for {\tt print.xtable}, so look
  at the help files for both {\tt xtable} and {\tt print.xtable}.

  For example, if you {\nhilit don't} want a table to be ``floating,''
  (within a {\tt table} environment, between
  {\tt {\textbackslash}begin\{table\}} and
  {\tt {\textbackslash}end\{table\}}),
  you need to use {\tt print.table} with {\tt floating=FALSE}.

\note{
  References with \LaTeX\/ are via BibTeX, which is fabulous once you
  get used to it. Most software to track references will produce
  BibTeX files for you.

  The formatting of citations and the reference listings, to match
  what the journal wants, can be painful. But I've figured out how to
  produce what \emph{Genetics\/} wants, and I send all of my papers
  there.

  The first box is the sort of code that would appear
  in your \LaTeX\/ file: the bit at the top goes in the header (before
  {\tt {\textbackslash}begin\{document\}}). The bit in the middle
  shows how to cite papers: use {\tt {\textbackslash}citep} to get the
  whole thing in parentheses, and use {\tt {\textbackslash}citet} to
  get a reference like ``...applied by Baggerly and Coombes (2008, 2009)...''
  The last bit in the first box produces the actual list of references.

  The second box is the BibTeX format for a particular reference.

  When you use BibTeX, you tend to run {\tt pdflatex}, then {\tt
  bibtex}, and then {\tt pdflatex} a couple of more times.

  This is how I organize a paper related to a larger project.

  Some of the work in the main project may be re-done a bit
  differently (or cleaner) in the analysis with the paper.

  You don't want to re-do {\nhilit all} analyses for the paper, but
  it'd also be nice to have the data and code related to the paper be
  a bit more self-contained.

  And usually when you're sitting down to write the paper, you have
  better ideas about how to re-do things properly, and so it might be
  a good idea to go ahead and re-do things.

  Ideally, you'd separate out each aspect of the analysis: data
  manipulation, data cleaning, and different parts of the analysis.

  Have an R Markdown document describing each aspect, with the
  actual manuscript and its figures and tables drawing from the
  results of those R Markdown documents.

Then if I want to talk about a number, like \Sexpr{n}, I can

\note{
  Every statistic, figure and table in your manuscript should be fully

  {\tt {\textbackslash}Sexpr\{\}} liberally.

  This should inhibit you from writing numbers as words, though the
  \LaTeX\/ code can get a bit ugly.

  There's a bit of fanciness here about capitalization and about
  ensuring that singular or plural nouns are correct. If
  {\tt {\textbackslash}Sexpr\{\}} produces a character string, it ends
  up as plain text in your document

  I'll use a lot of {\tt myround()} from my R/broman package, too.

  then write a {\tt Makefile} for the manuscript construction and
  include them with {\tt {\textbackslash}includegraphics}.

  The advantage of this is the ability to reuse the figures in
  talks or whatever. Also, journals will generally want the figures as
  separate files. Finally, the code for my figures is often incredibly
  long and ugly, so it's best to separate it out.

  Ideally, the code for a figure would be structured as a function and
  then a function call.  Put a bit more effort into the code, so that
  you can reuse it later for a similar figure with different data.
  At the very least, you should write the repeated bits as functions.

  If your function takes arguments that define the placement of
