_due 30 April 2020_

In the zip file [`hw4_data.zip`](hw4_data.zip) there is a
data file plus a data dictionary, both as CSV files.


1. Build a model to predict diabetes from the other variables, for
   example using logistic regression, regression trees, regression
   forest, or other means.


2. Assess the performance of your predictions. What are the
   specificity and sensitivity?


3. Assess the relative importance of the variables. Which variables
   are most important for predicting diabetes?
