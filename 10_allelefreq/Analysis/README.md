## Genehunter-plus analyses

- running genehunter-plus (ghp) on affected sibling data for prostate
  cancer

- compare results with good estimates of allele frequencies
  to those where the allele frequencies are messed
  up by having the first allele be very frequent (generally > 0.5)

- R/gh_results.rds contains the results with good allele frequency
  estimates

- R/gh_results_rev.rds contains the results with bad allele frequency
  estimates

- the original data are not included in the repository

- the genehunter-plus software available at
  <http://galton.uchicago.edu/genehunterplus/Current/>

  (needed to change "SOLARIS" to "OSF" in the Makefile)
